# FourierSeriesGUI
A user friendly app designed with MATLAB that allows you to generate a Fourier Series Waveform with the desired input variables.


## Open the app with MATLAB
Open the `FSgenerator.mlapp` in MATLAB. <br>

This image is an illustration of how the app looks and the waveform generated is an example of one of the waveforms which is the **Rectangular Waveform**. <br>
A reference for the Fouriers Series Table[^1]. <br> <br> <br>



### To use the app
-----

First fill in the variables:

>`Time Domain` for chnaging the time domain of the waveform. <br>
>`Frequency` for changing the frequency of the waveform <br>
>`Amplitude` for changing the amplitude of the waveform <br>
>`No. of Harmonics` for deciding the number of harmonics in the waveform. <br>
>`Horizontal Shift` for shifting the waveform horizontaly. <br>
>`Phase Shift(degrees)` for shifting the phase in degrees of the waveform.

- Now Select one of the waveforms. <br>
- You can view the changes of a particular waveform by filling in the variables, selecting the waveform, changing the inputs again and reselecting the same waveform. <br> <br> <br>

`code.m` contains the code used for the app.
